# Domestic Cats Ontology

## Background

This ontology was developed for the group project of CS3613: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence on the title "Domestic Cats".

### Domain and Scope

The domain covers different types of domestic cats (Felis catus). This ontology does not include wild cats or other related species, but rather focuses specifically on domestic cats as they are typically kept as pets in households around the world.

For the purposes of this ontology we will consider the cat breeds recognized by the Cat Fanciers’ Association (CFA) which is one of the oldest cat registries in the world. 
In cases where both the natural and crossbreed versions of the cat breed are present, the ontology will only consider the modern crossbreed version of the breed, since the more recent crossbreed variety is more likely to be taken as pets.
